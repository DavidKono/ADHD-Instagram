ADHD Instagram/ Instagram account blocker is a simple extension for firefox browser that makes instagram more useable by only showing accounts you specifically want to see.
This is for the niche case where you use instagram for messaging purposes, but still want to see posts from certain users, eg for events listing, so cannot use a normal element blocker to hide timewasting content.
This allows you to follow people without their ####posts clouding up your feed, and blocks out ads or recommendations.

Replace the names in block_account.js' allowed_accounts array with the accounts you wish to view.
Once the accounts array is updated, navigate to about:debugging in firefox. Click on the 'This Firefox' tab and click load temporary add-on. Select the manifest.json file and you are done.
